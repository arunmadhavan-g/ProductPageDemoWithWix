# Product Details - Demo App using Wix components

Check out the [Demo](https://arunmadhavan-g.github.io/ProductPageDemoWithWix/)

This is a demo app that uses the [Wix components](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react).
The project also uses *Redux* for state handling

Points to remember while trying the Demo

1. The add the cart would just show the increase in cart count
2. The buy now does not work
3. For getting an "available" state for pincode lookup use the pin `600004`

This is a very minimal demo.
